The recently leaked Apple A17 Pro system-on-chip (SoC) benchmark results for some of the latest Apple smartphones reveal that they can easily keep up with competition from AMD and Intel in Geekbench 6.
What does that mean in results? In the single-core test, the A17 Pro achieved scores in the 10 percent range of an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X or an Intel Core i9-13900K. Specifically, it was 2,914 points in the single-core test for the A17 Pro, while the i9-13900K from Intel scored 3,223 points and the Ryzen processor has a strong 3,172. It should also be noted that Apple's A17 Pro “only” works at 3.75 GHz, while competitors used up to 6 GHz.
Tom's Hardware makes it clear that these are extremely impressive results for the single-core test and that the A17 Pro, with its almost 2,900 points, does not need to hide behind the competitors' desktop CPUs. Sure, it's a special benchmark test and not all results could be so rosy. But for starters, this was still a solid start!
The fact that the A17 Pro was able to perform 10 percent better in single-core than its predecessor, the A16 Bionic, is also solid. In multi-core, however, it has only been 7,200 points — just 3 percent more than the A16. In any case, this seems to confirm: The A17 Pro is actually the best mobile CPU that Apple has ever built into a smartphone!
The impressive result of the Apple A17 Pro SoC in the Geekbench 6 single-core test is extremely promising. Although it's a specialized test, it's incredible that a smartphone processor can keep up with desktop processors in every way, and it highlights the efficiency of Apple Silicon.
In the past, however, the same was demonstrated not only by smartphone processors, but also by the magnificent Apple M1 and M2 chips, which were much stronger than the previously used Intel alternative. And now that the M3 chip could possibly still be available in 2023, we have even more reason to rejoice!
When a simple smartphone chip can finally conjure up such terrific performances, it's hard to imagine what the M3 might be able to do. Improved technology, serious architectural changes, focus on professionals and more complex gaming applications and the like certainly give hope for nothing less than the best result from Cupertino!
