Apple is expected to add the original first-generation 12-inch Macbook to its pile of outdated products at the end of June, likely in hopes of making room for newer products and future innovations.
The information was uncovered by MacRumors based on an internal memo and could mean bad news for anyone who still clings to one of these nostalgic devices. Apple typically classifies a product as “technologically obsolete” when seven years have passed since the company stopped selling it.
Even though it's been seven years since it was launched, the product isn't considered obsolete until seven years have passed since Apple stopped selling it. Due to Apple's relatively fast release frequency, several products have already been thrown into the deep, dark waste pit, including the iMacs from 2012-2014 and the Apple Watch Series 2.
Once the 12-inch Macbook is considered obsolete, it can no longer be repaired or technically supported at Apple Stores and authorized service providers, as spare parts and training are no longer available. Originally, it was discontinued in April 2016, after the second-generation model was released.
The 12-inch Macbook was first introduced in March 2015 and was Apple's first fanless notebook. It had a single USB-C port for charging and data transfer and was arguably one of the most important products that put Apple on young people's radar and established the company as a staple for Gen Z and millennials.
For the classic 12-inch Macbook, it's now “rest in peace”: We'll never forget the FOMO share we experienced when the iconic rose gold Macbooks were all over Tumblr and Pinterest.
