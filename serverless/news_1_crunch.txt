The next big upgrade to Apple’s mobile devices could be foldability, according to multiple reports published Sunday. According to The Wall Street Journal, Apple is aiming to launch two foldable devices in the next few years. There’s a larger model with a 19-inch screen that could compete with desktop monitors, as well as a smaller model that would serve as a foldable iPhone, with a larger screen than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The Journal reports that Apple has been developing both devices for years, with the foldable iPhone likely to be ready first. The company is reportedly planning a 2026 launch, but that could be pushed back by a year. Bloomberg, meanwhile, describes the larger device as a giant iPad and said it has been the primary focus of Apple’s foldable development, although the company has also been “exploring” a foldable iPhone. Apparently the team is making significant progress toward its goal of creating a screen without the crease that’s visible on existing foldable screens when they’re open.
